this repository contain my implementation of a few graph based algorithms for a college course
the pariGraph module contains most of the heavylifting which is implamantation of a graph in an object oriented enviroument
the pariGraph module currently contains mainly two classes Node and Graph
Node : a node is defined by its uui and its list of adjacent nodes
Graph : a graph is simply a list of Nodes which contains methods that can be run on a graph. the set of methods needs completing and is currently lacking many potential methods
Tree : to be implemented
DAG : to be implemented
